# Machine-Learning Project - Fraud Detection in Electricity and Gas Consumption Using XGBoost

The Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG) is a public and a non-administrative company, it is responsible for delivering electricity and gas across Tunisia. The company suffered tremendous losses in the order of 200 million Tunisian Dinars due to fraudulent manipulations of meters by consumers.

Using the client’s billing history, the aim of the challenge is to detect and recognize clients involved in fraudulent activities. The solution will enhance the company’s revenues and reduce the losses caused by such fraudulent activities. 

In this notebook the potential of the **XBoost** classifier is evaluated for the detection of fraudulent cases.
